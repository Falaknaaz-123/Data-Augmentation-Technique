# Probabilistic-Forecasting-of-Time-Series
This is an implementation of  Forecasting of Electrical parameters using Autoregressive Neural Networks(Machine Learning):

Variables considered- Voltage (V), Charge Capacity (Ah), Discharge Capacity, Current.

Autoregressive Neural Networks were used to forecast electrical parameters like Voltage, Current, State-of-Charge which helps to solve the limited data challenges. 
Tech: Python.
